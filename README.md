# React SSR

This is a simple setup for a typical React app with Redux, React Router and Node.js

I've included some basic Server Side Rendering (SSR) to help with page crawling etc.

### Getting started

Do the usual npm install or yarn install

* For local dev just run npm start or yarn start and navigate to http://localhost:3333
* For server side development / production builds run npm dev or yarn dev and navigate to http://localhost:3334

If you need more commands and info, just take a look at the package.json

#### Motivation for this project

In the past, I've typically used the create-react-app for my projects. However, I've recently required a little more control. So, this project is being used to skill-up and refresh myself with webpack and modern Javascript in general.

I'll try and comment where possible and include updates with things I learn along the way.

Cheers.
